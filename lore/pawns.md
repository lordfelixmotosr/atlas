## When a system refers to colonists by name, use Nick (LabelShort) not NameTriple.First

RimWorld colonists carry a `NameTriple(First, Nick, Last)`. The in-game UI — colonist bar, inspector, letters, chat bubbles — always shows the **Nick**, not the **First**. Vanilla generation often produces pairs like `("Otto", "Crane", "Jacobson")` where the player only ever sees "Crane".

If you're serialising the roster for an LLM, a notification, or any UI string, use `pawn.Name.ToStringShort` (which is `NameTriple.Nick`) or equivalently `pawn.LabelShort`. If you use `NameTriple.First` you'll get names the player doesn't recognise and the system will look like it's hallucinating ("the chat said Otto/Sly/Renata but my colonists are Crane/Jacobson/Steele").

For pawn lookup by name from an external string (LLM output, save file, network), match against Nick FIRST, then fall back to First — be lenient on input since both names exist on the pawn, but always *emit* Nick.

*Why it's tricky:* NameTriple looks like a flat name tuple, and `First` is the obvious thing to reach for. There's no compile-time signal that you've picked the wrong field — the test only fails when a player happens to roll a vanilla pawn whose First differs from their Nick (which is most of them).

## Vanilla trait names in the UI are often degree labels of a spectrum TraitDef, not standalone defs

When the in-game trait label is something like "nervous", "kind", "hard worker", "lazy", "depressive", the *displayed* word is usually one degree of a spectrum `TraitDef` — the defName itself names the spectrum. `nervous` is degree `-1` of `Nerves`. `hard worker` is degree `1` of `Industriousness`. `pessimist` is degree `-1` of `NaturalMood`. The dead giveaway is `[Commander] Unknown TraitDef: Nervous` (or similar) — the user-facing name doesn't resolve through `DefDatabase<TraitDef>.GetNamed`.

Recipe to find the real (defName, degree): `search_source '<label>nervous</label>' --filePattern '**/TraitDefs/*.xml'` — the file path tells you it's `Traits_Spectrum.xml`, and the surrounding XML shows the parent `<defName>` + the `<degree>` of that `<li>` in `<degreeDatas>`. Then add as `new Trait(td, degree, forced: true)` with the right degree value.

*Why it's tricky:* TraitDef lookup-by-defName fails silently for the most common-sounding labels because the wiki, in-game tooltips, and player intuition all use the per-degree label. Knee-jerk renaming attempts ("Nervous" → "QuickLearner" → "FastLearner") never converge if the symbol you want is a spectrum degree, not a standalone TraitDef.

## Making a humanlike crawl-attack when downed requires faking the IsMutant gates

Vanilla humanlikes never crawl-attack when downed — the whole system (introduced for Anomaly shamblers) is gated behind `pawn.IsMutant`. Three places need to flip for a humanlike to behave like a shambler:

1. **`Pawn_HealthTracker.MakeDowned`** calls `pawn.ClearMind_NewTemp(wasDowned: true)` unless `pawn.IsMutant && CanCrawl && mutant.Def.canAttackWhileCrawling`. ClearMind nukes the current job, so even if everything else worked the pawn would just lie there. Fix: Harmony **prefix on `Pawn.ClearMind_NewTemp` returning false** when `wasDowned == true` AND your pawn kind matches (e.g. `kindDef.defName == "Zombie"`).
2. **`Pawn.CanAttackWhileCrawling`** (getter) returns `mutant.Def.canAttackWhileCrawling` or false. Used by `Toils_Combat` and the `ThreatDisabled` check at `Pawn.cs:~4111` (`if (Downed && (!CanAttackWhileCrawling || !Crawling)) return true;`). Fix: Harmony **postfix on the getter** to force `__result = true` for your kind. Without this, downed pawns are flagged "threat disabled" and enemies stop targeting them, and any toil that wants to attack while crawling bails.
3. (Optional) The pawn's current job needs `isCrawlingIfDowned = true`. This **defaults to true** on `JobDef`; only a handful of vanilla jobs (joy, childcare, a few misc) override to false, so combat jobs from a Manhunter mental state are fine.

Don't try to fake `IsMutant` itself — `mutant` is null for non-Anomaly pawns and the rest of the codebase will NRE the moment it tries to dereference `pawn.mutant.Def`.

*Why it's tricky:* The "downed but still crawling" behavior LOOKS like a generic pawn capability — it's not. It's an Anomaly mechanic and the gates are scattered across three files. Patching just `CanAttackWhileCrawling` isn't enough because `MakeDowned`'s ClearMind kills the job before any combat code runs.

## When you want a colonist to live abroad without being on any map, use DeSpawn + WorldPawns.PassToWorld(KeepForever)

For mechanics where a colonist needs to be *somewhere else* for an extended period — diplomatic postings, deep covers, long quests, hostage exchanges, exile, sabbaticals — the right vanilla pattern is:

```csharp
// Outbound: pawn leaves the colony to live elsewhere
if (pawn.Spawned)
    pawn.DeSpawn();
if (!Find.WorldPawns.Contains(pawn))
    Find.WorldPawns.PassToWorld(pawn, PawnDiscardDecideMode.KeepForever);

// Inbound: pawn returns from being abroad
if (Find.WorldPawns.Contains(pawn))
    Find.WorldPawns.RemovePawn(pawn);
GenSpawn.Spawn(pawn, DropCellFinder.TradeDropSpot(map), map);
```

Key points:
- **DeSpawn FIRST.** `WorldPawns.PassToWorld` logs an error and refuses if `pawn.Spawned == true`.
- **`PawnDiscardDecideMode.KeepForever`** is essential — without it, vanilla's WorldPawnGC may decide the pawn isn't important and discard them (their data freed, references nulled). KeepForever adds them to `pawnsForcefullyKeptAsWorldPawns` which is GC-safe.
- **The pawn ages normally** while in WorldPawns. Vanilla's mothballing ticks them at reduced frequency, applying needs/age/disease over time. No special handling needed for "the diplomat got older while abroad."
- **The pawn can die normally** too (old age, hediffs). Detect via `pawn.Dead` in a slow tick; vanilla doesn't fire any event when a world pawn dies.
- **Relationships, hediffs, skills, inventory are preserved** across the round-trip. You don't need to snapshot/restore anything — Scribe handles them as part of the pawn ref.
- **Use `Scribe_References.Look(ref pawn, "fieldName")`** on the field that holds the pawn ref. This survives save/load correctly across the despawn/spawn cycle.

*Why it's tricky:* if you reach for `Pawn.Destroy()` or set `pawn.Spawned = false` directly or use `Notify_PawnSold`, you get cascading bugs — `Destroy` actually destroys the pawn and discards them; manual `Spawned` flag changes don't update `Map.mapPawns`. The clean state machine is DeSpawn → PassToWorld(KeepForever), and the reverse for return. Vanilla uses this same pattern for quest pawns, captured Empire titleholders, slaves sold to caravans, etc.

## When finding a Pawn by ThingID across maps/caravans, use PawnsFinder with the British double-L "Travelling"

To resolve a pawn that may be on a map OR in a caravan/transporter, use `PawnsFinder.AllMapsCaravansAndTravellingTransporters_Alive` (or the `_FreeColonists` variant for colonists). Map-only is `Find.Maps[...].mapPawns.AllPawns`.

*Why it's tricky:* RimWorld spells it **"Travelling"** with two L's (British spelling), so `AllCaravansAndTravelingTransportPods_AliveOrDead` and `AllMapsCaravansAndTravelingTransporters_Alive` (one L) both fail to compile with `CS0117: 'PawnsFinder' does not contain a definition`. The single-L American spelling is the natural guess and is wrong. When in doubt, `read_symbol PawnsFinder` and copy the exact member name.

## When assigning fixed names to humanlike pawns, keep NameTriple not NameSingle

Humanlike pawn relation generation assumes parent names are `NameTriple`: `PawnRelationWorker_Parent.ResolveMyName` casts `generatedChild.GetFather().Name` / `GetMother().Name` to `NameTriple` when giving a child a parent surname. If you set a faction leader or other humanlike pawn to `new NameSingle("...")`, later pawn generation can throw `InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid` from `PawnRelationWorker_Parent.ResolveMyName`. Use `new NameTriple(first, nick, last)` even for mysterious/fixed names; put the display name in `Nick` because RimWorld's short label uses Nick.
