-- Per-game partitioning for the community-lore tables, so Minecraft and
-- RimWorld lore never collide. The two games share several topic names
-- (recipes, build, test-loop, assets, distribution, misc), so `game` has to
-- enter the PRIMARY KEY of both tables — otherwise a RimWorld lesson and a
-- Minecraft lesson under the same topic+hook would collide on UPSERT and one
-- would silently overwrite the other.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the original migration for this step
-- (2026-06-22-community-lore-game-id.sql, added in 859c2be) was authored
-- against a `game_id` + unique-INDEX design, then the live DB was hand-
-- corrected to a `game` column + game-inclusive PRIMARY KEYS and the stale file
-- was deleted in cfae866 without a committed replacement. That left the next
-- migration (2026-06-23-reviewed-lore-hooks-game.sql) selecting a `game` column
-- that no committed migration creates. This file restores the missing step in
-- the corrected shape and MUST run before 2026-06-23.
--
-- Everything here is additive, backfilling, and idempotent: existing rows
-- default to game='rimworld', and re-applying on a DB already at the target
-- shape (e.g. a branch forked from production) is a no-op.
--
-- Target shape (verified against project hietsknsycjlcrvfgqaz):
--   community_lore    PRIMARY KEY (game, topic, hook)
--   lore_submissions  PRIMARY KEY (game, device_id, topic, hook)
--
-- Apply via: supabase MCP apply_migration, or psql against the project.

-- 1. `game` columns. Adding a NOT NULL column with a constant default is a
--    metadata-only change (no table rewrite); existing rows read as 'rimworld'.
alter table public.community_lore
  add column if not exists game text not null default 'rimworld';
alter table public.lore_submissions
  add column if not exists game text not null default 'rimworld';

-- 2. Fold `game` into each table's PRIMARY KEY (game first), unless it's already
--    there. After the backfill, (game, …) uniqueness reduces to the OLD key's
--    uniqueness, so the new PK is guaranteed to build. The old PK name is read
--    from the catalog so this is independent of how it was named.
