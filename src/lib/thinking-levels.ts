 * Modmixer's thinking scale: pi's levels plus a `max` rung on top.
 *
 * pi 0.80.x tops out at `xhigh`; there is no sixth level upstream. Rather
 * than patching pi's dist (as the pre-0.80 patch set did), `max` lives
 * entirely on the modmixer side of the boundary — settings, conversations,
 * and the picker store it — and `toPiThinking` lowers it onto pi as `xhigh`
 * on a model instance whose thinkingLevelMap sends Anthropic's `max`
 * adaptive effort. Renderer-safe: type-only pi imports, no electron.
