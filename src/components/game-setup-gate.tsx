/**
 * Blocks chat until the active game is fully set up — every *required*
 * prerequisite check is green AND the code index is fresh. Recommended checks
 * (ModsConfig.xml, .NET) are deferred so they never wall a working user out of
 * chat; the test loop re-checks the ones it needs. Shares its entire body (the
 * requirement checks + the index build/progress) with onboarding's Setup step
 * via <GameSetupBody>, so the two paths stay identical and we make them robust
 * once.
 *
 * - allClear (required checks ok + index fresh) → renders nothing; chat proceeds.
 * - not modOpen (just the library lens on a game) → never nags; renders nothing.
 * - otherwise → a blocking overlay showing the unmet checks + index progress.
 *
 * The decompile is load-bearing for the agent (search/scaffold) and the checks
 * gate a working test loop, so this is a hard gate on *chatting* with this mod —
 * there's no "chat anyway". It is not a trap, though: the gate already contains
 * the full setup UI (checks + their fix actions + index build), so the only
 * other affordance it needs is a way *out* — `onExit` steps back to Home so a
 * user who isn't ready to set this game up isn't walled into a dead end.
