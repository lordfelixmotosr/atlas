/**
 * The cookbook is a curated, repo-shipped reference library for external
 * frameworks (Combat Extended, Harmony, ...) that the agent cannot learn by
 * reading the mod's own code. It is deliberately NOT the lore system:
 *
 *   - lore     = hard-won, append-as-you-go gotchas, agent-writable
 *   - cookbook = distilled how-to reference, human-curated, read-only
 *
 * Keeping them separate matters: lore stays high-signal ("every entry is a
 * lesson worth reading") only if it isn't diluted with bulky reference
 * material. New gotchas the agent discovers still go to lore; a lore entry
 * can cross-link a cookbook section.
 *
 * Layout on disk — one directory per "page", one markdown file per "section":
 *
 *   cookbook/
 *     ce-compat/overview.md
 *     ce-compat/ranged-weapons.md
 *     harmony/transpiler.md
 *
 * The agent reads a section with the ordinary `read` tool — there is no
 * dedicated cookbook tool, to keep the tool count small (non-frontier models
 * route better with fewer tools). Two things make plain `read` work:
 *
 *   1. cookbookDir() is added to PathPolicyRoots so `read` is allowed to
 *      reach it — the cookbook lives outside the mod-workspace sandbox.
 *   2. buildSystemPrompt embeds the catalogue (absolute path + title per
 *      section) so the agent knows the files exist and where they are.
 *
 * Sections are kept small (roughly one screenful) so a whole-file `read`
 * never becomes a context sink; there is intentionally no "read the whole
 * page" affordance.
