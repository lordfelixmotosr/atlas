/**
 * Minimal ResourceLoader that returns a single, externally-supplied system
 * prompt and no skills/themes/agents files. May host a small set of
 * pre-built in-process extensions (see buildStripThinkingExtension).
 *
 * pi-coding-agent's DefaultResourceLoader scans .pi/ folders for skills,
 * prompts, themes, extensions, and AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md ancestor files. We
 * don't ship any of that — ModMixer's system prompt is composed in code from
 * the conversation scope. This loader keeps the AgentSession happy without
 * spinning up that machinery.
 *
 * Considered at pi 0.80.x and rejected: DefaultResourceLoader with the no*
 * flags + extensionFactories. Even fully flagged off, its reload() still
 * runs the extension package manager and settings-sourced extension
 * resolution against agentDir — meaning a user's pi settings.json could
 * inject extensions into ModMixer sessions. A custom ResourceLoader is the
 * documented SDK seam for exactly this hermetic setup (docs/sdk.md), so this
 * class is the deliberate choice, not a stopgap. Revisit only if upstream
 * exports loadExtensionFromFactory at the package root (it's internal as of
 * 0.80.3), which would let the extension shells in snapshot-extension.ts /
 * strip-thinking-extension.ts become plain factories.
 *
 * The system prompt is fixed for the lifetime of the loader. Scope changes
 * (e.g. a legacy folder-less conversation being bound to a mod on first open —
 * see bindNewScopeToMod) are handled by reconstructing the AgentSession with a
 * fresh loader, not by mutating an existing one.
 *
 * Stability matters beyond a single in-memory loader: the same byte string
 * must resurface on every rehydration of a conversation (across app
 * restarts, scope upgrades, etc.), because OpenRouter's sticky provider
 * routing keys off the hash of the first system message. The persisted
 * snapshot lives on the `Conversation` record — see
 * `Conversation.systemPrompt` and `buildSystemPrompt` for the broader
 * invariant.
