 * Chat file attachments. A user can attach files by drag-drop, paste
 * (clipboard bitmap or Explorer copy), or the browse button. The renderer
 * can't read disk, so it hands the main process either a path (drag/browse/
 * Explorer copy) or raw bytes (a pasted screenshot, which has no path). Main
 * resolves both into a `PreparedAttachment` the chip row and `send` use.
