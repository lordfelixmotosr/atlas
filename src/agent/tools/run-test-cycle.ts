/**
 * Single-call macro for the test-in-game flow. Both the parameter schema and the
 * behavior live in the adapter (RimWorld → ship/launch via Steam + ModsConfig,
 * with palette/quicktest/isolated knobs; Minecraft → gradlew runClient, folder
 * only). The macro stays thin: take the adapter's schema, lift the neutral
 * `folder`, hand the rest to the adapter as opaque params, dispatch.
 *
 * Built per conversation: `conversationId` is captured so the background bridge
 * monitor the cycle arms is bound to the chat that launched the test, even when
 * several mod tabs are open at once. The host callbacks (startMonitoring /
 * reportTestDiagnostic) are injected into the context here — that's why the
 * adapters never import agent-host.ts (avoids an import cycle).
 *
 * `cwd` is the mod folder (the session's working directory): the tested mod is
 * always the one the chat is bound to, so the schema carries no folder arg and
 * ctx.folder is derived here. Dispatch keys off the conversation's `game` (the
 * same source as the tool description and schema), so the tool the model sees
 * and the adapter it runs are always the same game.
