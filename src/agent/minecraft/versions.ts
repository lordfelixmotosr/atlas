 * version is a deliberate, tested change here, not a runtime variable.
 *
 * These should be validated against maven.neoforged.net / parchmentmc before a
 * release bump — the gradlew build fails loudly if a pinned coordinate doesn't
 * resolve, so a stale pin surfaces immediately rather than silently.

 * patch is valid for 1.21.1. Resolved against maven metadata at scaffold time
