/**
 * The behavioral half of multi-game support. `src/agent/games/` is the pure,
 * renderer-safe *descriptor* (identity, display, capability flags); this module
 * is the MAIN-PROCESS *adapter* that owns per-game behavior (build, test,
 * scaffold, …). The descriptor says "Minecraft publishes to Modrinth"; the
 * adapter is what actually runs `gradlew` and talks to Modrinth.
 *
 * Why the split: `src/agent/games/` is imported directly by ~10 renderer
 * components, so it must never pull in `electron`/`node:*`. The per-game adapter
 * impls live in their own folder (`<game>/adapter.ts`) and call hard main-only
 * modules (`<game>/*`, `rimworld/ship.ts`, `rimworld/workshop.ts`, …); this file
 * holds only the shared interface, and `adapters/index.ts` the dispatch table.
 *
 * Design rule (matches games/registry.ts): everything dispatches on `GameId`;
 * adding a game means implementing this interface, which the type checker then
 * forces to be complete — no more "forgot to gate" call sites.
