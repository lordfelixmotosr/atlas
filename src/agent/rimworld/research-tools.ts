    "Look up XML defs in the indexed Core + DLCs corpus. Three modes in one tool:\n\n• default — search by defName / label / description / abstract Name. Pass a single keyword (\"Pirate\") or a few whitespace-separated terms (\"BaseHuman raider\") — terms are AND'd. Abstract defs (those with `Name=\"…\"` and no `defName`, e.g. `FactionBase`) are matched on their Name attribute. When exactly one def matches, the full merged XML is returned inline.\n• descendantsOf=<Name> — find every def that extends a parent via ParentName (e.g. \"BaseFilth\"). Pass recursive=true to walk transitively.\n• referencedBy=<defName> — find every C# source location that mentions this defName by string literal.\n\nTemplate-fetch idiom: when you know the exact defName and just want its full XML to copy from (e.g. \"show me the Pirate FactionDef as a template\"), call with `limit=1` (and optionally `merged=true` to fold ParentName inheritance inline). That collapses the common search → identify → re-fetch chain into one call.\n\nThis tells you what XML data exists. For code BEHAVIOR (how does X work, why isn't Y firing, what's the right API pattern) start with search_source or read_symbol — the def database can't tell you how the engine consumes a def. Zero results here doesn't mean nothing exists; it usually means the answer lives in C# source, not XML.",
