/**
 * Build a pi-coding-agent extension that strips `thinking` content blocks
 * from older assistant messages before each LLM call.
 *
 * Why: thinking blocks are persisted in the session transcript (so the UI can
 * render past reasoning, and so providers that need signature-continuity get
 * it). Once we're past that point the historical blocks are dead weight on
 * the input side — Kimi K2.6 in particular emits 1–13 KB blocks per turn,
 * and a long session pays for them on every subsequent request. Stripping
 * conservatively still saves real tokens with no quality impact.
 *
 * What we KEEP (in priority order):
 *   1. Thinking on the LAST assistant message. Anthropic's extended-thinking
 *      contract requires the prior assistant's signed thinking block to be
 *      present verbatim when the next request includes tool_results.
 *   2. Thinking on any "thinking-only" assistant message — a turn whose only
 *      content blocks are thinking (no text, no toolCall). Kimi sometimes
 *      returns control to the user this way and the UI renders the thinking
 *      as the visible reply; dropping those would erase chat history.
 *   3. Thinking on any assistant message that contains a tool call. Kimi
 *      K2.6 on OpenRouter (and likely other reasoning models on the
 *      openai-completions API surface) rejects requests with
 *      `thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing in assistant
 *      tool call message at index N` when reasoning is on but a prior
 *      tool-call message has had its thinking stripped. There's no per-API
 *      gate for this — the safe default is to keep thinking on ALL
 *      tool-calling assistant turns, not just the most recent.
 *
 * What we DROP: thinking on assistant messages that have text content but
 * no tool calls, and aren't the last assistant. Those are intermediate
 * "I'm narrating progress to the user" replies whose reasoning is no
 * longer load-bearing on subsequent turns.
