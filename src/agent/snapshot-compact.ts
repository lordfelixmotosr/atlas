 * scratch: every save still in the manifest is materialized and re-committed
 * into a fresh repo.git, then the new repo is swapped in and the old one
 * (holding every unreachable blob — for RimWorld mods that's dominated by
 * per-turn chat-JSONL copies) is deleted.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of electron imports so the node:test
 * suite can exercise it directly against scratch directories. snapshots.ts
 * owns folder→directory resolution, locking, and event emission.
