/**
 * Dev-only automation seam for the demo-video harness (~/projects/modmixer-demo).
 *
 * Loaded exclusively through the `import.meta.env.DEV` guard in renderer.tsx,
 * so this module — and the `window.__demo` global it installs — is statically
 * dead-code-eliminated from production bundles. The harness drives the app
 * over CDP and talks to these hooks via page.evaluate; nothing in the product
 * calls them except the single DEV-gated intercept in chat-panel's submit().
 *
 * Capabilities, by demo phase:
 *  - session run:  onEvent() taps every agent event envelope so the harness
 *                  can persist a timestamped transcript of a real agent run.
 *  - replay:       injectEvent() feeds those recorded envelopes back into the
 *                  conversation store on the harness's cinematic clock, and
 *                  setSendInterceptor() lets the harness swallow the real
 *                  send that typing-then-Enter would otherwise trigger.
